# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

In this project I had to create a quiz game from scratch. The HTML and CSS is fairly basic as most of the page will be dynamically generated with JavaScript. The appearance is basic but is meant to still be responsive for all screen sizes. The project is built to be a game that cycles through a series of questions within a time limit and your score is the time at the end. Wrong answers subtract 10 seconds and reaching 0 seconds will end the game. The highscores are saved to local storage and can be displayed when returning to the game. 

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the Start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```
